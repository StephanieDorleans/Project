# Project-1
I created this project in my Intro to C class. It is a simple guess the number game. There are three difficulty levels. The first difficulty level will be a number between 1-10 (including 10). The second difficultly level will be a number between 1-100 (including 100). The third difficulty level will be a number between 1-1000 (including 1000).
